                    Talking about the time and place is crucial while describing an event. 
                    In stories, especially fiction, the time and place together are called setting. 
                    So, talking about the setting of an event helps to visualize the place 
                    and time of the incident.
                    The most common and effective style of describing an event starts with defining the eventâ€™s location. 
                    The more you can be specific about the site; 
                    the more your audience (people you are describing the event to) will be engaged with your description.
