    <h2 align="center" style="color: rgb(12, 12, 12);">About College </h2>
    <p style="font-family:courier"; >techno india university is one of the premier institutions run under the aegis of KR's Sree Narayana Educational Trust, Thozhuvanoor, Valanchery. This institution is a sister concern of KR Bakes, a familiar brand name in the bakery field which has completed 47 years since its inception in 1969. The enviable growth of KR Bakes is attributed to the uncompromising and relentless attitude of the management regarding quality and technological up gradation. Taking lessons from the bakery business that if quality is not compromised, there would be demand for the product, the management of KR Bakes has decided to carry forward their legacy of the bakery business into the field of higher education by starting an Arts and Science college at Thozhuvanoor, Valanchery, one of the educationally backward areas of Kerala.
